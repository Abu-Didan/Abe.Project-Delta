This is the early skeleton of our mobile app built with React Native and Expo to help self employed individuals
manage their benefit plans. So far, we've implemented the loading screen, a login interface that lets users toggle between Employer and Employee roles, a personalized home screen, and a Plan Overview screen that displays mocked expense and reimbursement data. Note: None of the fields that take user input do anything yet, but the app flow still functions.

Navigation is handled through React Navigation using a stackbased flow. If you'd like to test the app on your own device, feel 
free to reach out — we can send you a live QR code using Expo’s tunnel feature so you can run it directly in the Expo Go app.
