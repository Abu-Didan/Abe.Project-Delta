This is the early skeleton of our mobile app built with React Native and Expo to help self employed individuals
manage their benefit plans. So far, we've implemented multiple screens to layout the navigation flow of the app, such as a welcome screen and home screen with personalized messages, a login screen, etc.

Navigation is handled through React Navigation using a stackbased flow. If you'd like to test the app on your own device, feel 
free to reach out — we can send you a live QR code using Expo’s tunnel feature so you can run it directly in the Expo Go app.
